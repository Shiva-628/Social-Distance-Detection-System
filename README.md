# Social-Distance-Detection-System
This project implements a Social Distance Detection System using OpenCV, MobileNetSSD (Caffe model), and Python. The system detects people in a video stream and calculates the physical distance between them. If two people are closer than the allowed limit (2 meters), the program highlights them in red yellow, otherwise green.
